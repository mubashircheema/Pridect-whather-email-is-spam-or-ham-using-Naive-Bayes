# Pridect-whather-email-is-spam-or-ham-using-Naive-Bayes
In this project, there are several different directories filled with e-mails. one is a bunch of emails that are spam that have been classified in advance and another directory full of emails that are ham. I am using this information to train my model. After the train, the model we use to predict the next message is spam or ham.
